Handles the logic of the game using a cartesian coordinate system.
Renders the game visually in a HTML5 canvas element.

To accomplish this, the game contains the following objects:

MovingObject
  * Sets the attributes of the object
  * Draws the object in a HTML5 canvas element
		
Asteroid
  * Inherits constructor and methods from moving object
	* Checks to see if another object is within it's own radius
	
Ship
  * Inherits constructor and methods from moving object
	* Generates a random location to start at
	* Allows the user to create a bullet object

Bullet
  * Inherits constructor and methods from moving object
	* Checks to see if another object is within it's own radius
	
Game
  * Keeps hold of all the objects in the game
	* Changes the position of every object after a predefined period of time
	* Removes objects which may have collided with each other
	
GameView
  * Captures the canvas element and passes it to the other objects so they can draw themselves in it
	* Binds the directional keys and space bar to actual events
